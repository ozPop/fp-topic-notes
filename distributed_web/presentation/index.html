  <h2>What does it mean?</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">The topic of Decentralized Web is not clearly defined and it means many things to many people, however the underlying theme revolves around the idea that we are experiencing a shift from free form to a form of consolidation and control. Lets see how some of the people behind the movement define it.</aside>

  <h2>Changing landscape</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">At its inception, the internet was being designed to be decentralized. Today, some believe the web is turning into something that looks and works differently when compared with the expectations of the pioneers of the web.</aside>

    <section data-transition="concave" data-background="/images/silos.png">
  <h2>Emergence of data and service silos</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">More recently, the web at large is becoming fragmented and those fragments (or silos as per Berners-Lee) becoming heavily centralized. These data silos hold all the information about us and in some cases we can not control this data, nor use it in any other way.</aside>

  <h2>Global surveilance, censorship, lack of permancence</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">The web has become more succeptible to global surveilance aparatus, corportate and government control, censorship, poor privacy practices, relatively weak security and so on.</aside>

  <h2>Decentralized Web Summit 2016</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">These are some of the concerns of advocates who urge more people to get involved in projects and technologies that could help mitigate this shift. The development of technologies based on decentralized architecture has been going on for some time but this year as a result of growing concerns, there was a gathering of developers in San Francisco on June 8th and 9th of 2016, to discuss how to make the web more secure, permanent, and resilient to censorship. </aside>

    <section data-transition="linear" data-background="/images/dec-web-systems.svg">
  <h2>Why Is The Summit important</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">The essense of that meeting was centerd around the topic of how to create decentralized systems taking inspiration from already existing technologies such as: P2P, Blockchain, Distributed Networking and more.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Points</h2>
  
    <ul> 
  
    <li>Increase media exposure</li>

    <li>Use the prestige of attendees to boost community interest</li>
  
</ul>
  
    <img class="stretch" src="images/group-photo-summit.jpg" alt="">
  
    <aside class="notes">Among the attendees were Sir Tim Berners-Lee (early web pioneer), Bewrster Khale (Internet Archive), Mitchell Baker (Mozilla Project), Vint Cerf (co-creator of TCP/IP). The hope seems to be that the reputation of some of the participants will boost peoples interest in this movement and technologies related to it. ===>> Lets swtich over to Gordon, who will tell us a little about some of these foundational technologies that the decentralized web may be based upon.</aside>

  <h2></h2>
  
    <img class="stretch" src="images/types-of-networks.png" alt="">
  
    <aside class="notes">Here we have an example of a few types of networks. Currently the most dominant is the centralized architecture. Those who are familiar with Peer to Peer may have seen this Distributed type. Lastly, we have the decentralized network type.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear" data-background="/images/ipfs-illustration-centralized.svg">
  <h2>Centralized</h2>
  
    <p>The Client-Server model</p>
  
    <aside class="notes"> Most of us are familiar with this type of architecture. It is based on client-server model where clients make requests and in most cases recieve recourses from a centralized location.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear" data-background="/images/networking.gif">
  <h2>Peer to peer</h2>
  
    <p>Distributed network technology</p>
  
    <aside class="notes">Peer-to-peer based technologies are already being used by individuals and a number of companies. Tech based on P2P has potential for mass scale applications and is considered by some to be central to the Decentralized movement. In short, P2P enables members of the network, known as peers, to have equivalent capabilities and resposabilities when sharing resources without relying on a centralized authority.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Several types of P2P networks exist</h2>
  
    <img class="stretch" src="images/p2p-binary.jpg" alt="">
  
    <ul> 
  
    <li>Collaborative computing</li>
  
    <li>Instant messaging</li>
  
    <li>Affinity Communities</li>
  
</ul>
  
    <aside class="notes">There exist several types of P2P networs. Collaborative computing - combines idle or unused resource of individual workstations AKA Distibuted computing || Instant messaging - enables real time communication || Affinity Communities - are based around file distribution</aside>

  <h2>Amazon Cloud Correlation</h2>
  
    <img class="stretch" src="images/aws-global.png" alt="">
  
    <aside class="notes">Amazon cloud is hybrid between centralized and distributed computing. Data is often stored and proccessed in various locations of the globe to improve reliability and performance. || What if we could make the next generation Web work like that across the entire Internet? AWS provides an exceptional service and will continue to do so, but what if we came up with reliable technology that involved everyone to provide content as much as consume it?</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>BitTorrent</h2>
  
    <ul> 
  
    <li>Blizzard uses BitTorrent to distributed their games and updates</li>
  
    <li>Facebook and Twitter use BitTorrent internally</li>
  
    <li>The Internet Archive offers their content through this technology</li>
  
    <li>Government Agencies use it</li>
  
    <li>Linux is distributed using BitTorrent</li>
  
</ul>
  
    <aside class="notes">Some of you may have heard of BitTorent protocol (based on P2P architecture) being used for illegal file sharing. Here are some exmaples of legitimate uses of this protocol.</aside>

    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>needs image</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">The power behind distributed networks is in numbers. The more organizations and inviduals that get involved, the more redundant, and fast the services would become. Supporters of decentralization believe that P2P based technologies could help us achieve a more decentralized web.</aside>

    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Blockchain technology</h2>
  
    <p>Blockchain technology could help manage and secure the Decentralized Web data.</p>
  
    <aside class="notes">The next technology I would like to bring to your attention is Blockchain technology which could be used to manage and secure Decentralized data. A blockchain also known as a distributed ledger is comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Blockchain technology p2</h2>
  
    <aside class="notes">These digitally recorded blocks of data are stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain contains data which is cryptographically hashed. The block of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which comes before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall blockchain has not been tampered with and remains unchanged.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Multiple Applications</h2>
  
    <ul> 
  
    <li>Finance - secure and instant transactions</li>
  
    <li>Property - recodring history over time</li>
  
    <li>Contracts - self executing and self enforcing contracts</li>
  
    <li>Identity - verify, authorize and manage unique identities</li>
  
</ul>
  
    <aside class="notes">Blockchain technology has multiple applications. In finance we may have secure and instant transactions involving currency || It can be used to track unique histories of physical and  non-physical property || We may create programmable, self executing and self enforcing contracts. Applicable in industries such as the Music and Real Estate || It could revolutionize how we verify, authorize and manage unique identities across the web</aside>

  <h2>Distributed Version Control Correlation</h2>
  
    <p>Git Effect</p>
  
    <aside class="notes">Git is a good example of a peer-to-peer approach that has had a strong effect on the whole industry. It is now being used by the majority of developers.</aside>
  
</section>
  
    <section data-transition="linear">
  <h2>Benefits of Git</h2>
  
    <ul> 
  
    <li>Allows private work and without needing a network connection</li>
  
    <li>Allows participation in project without permission</li>
  
    <li>Each repo effectively fuctions as a remote backup which improves redundancy</li>
  
    <li>Making most operations fast</li>
  
    <li>Communication is only necessary when sharing changes</li>
  
</ul>
  
    <aside class="notes">As oposed to a centralized repository that everyone was working with, git enabled us all to have our own copy of the codebase and introduced some important differences from a centralized system. || Now let us turn back to Ozzie who will show us some of the emerging decentralized technologies.</aside>
