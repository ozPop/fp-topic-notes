### Peer to Peer (e.g.: Bitorrent)

Peer-to-peer technology is one of the core technologies that is already being 
used to introduce a way we can distribute websites across the web.

The core of this technology is the partitioning of work load between all 
peers (members) and allowing indivual units involved in the network to share 
resources.

In other words, the peers dedicate portions of processing power, memory, or 
network bandwith to other participating peers without relying on a centralized
authority.


### Blockchain technology (e.g.: Bitcoin)

A Blockchain is a distributed ledger of unchangable, digitally recorded data. 

Various kinds of data can be recorded in a blockchain and unline traditional 
data storage, which consists of centralized administration, blockchain has 
the benefit of being distributed.

It can be applied in:

* Finance - Secure and instant transactions involving currency
* Property - It can be used to track unique histories of physical and 
    non-physical property
* Contracts - Programmable, self executing and self enforcing contracts
    Applicable in various industries such as the Music and Real Estate
* Identity - Revolutionizing how we verify, authorize and manage unique 
    identities across the web
