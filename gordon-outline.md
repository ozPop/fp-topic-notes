## The Decentralized Web foundational techonologies 

(Starts with slide **image** of types of networks)

Here we have a few animated examples of the types of networks that exist.

Currently the most dominant is the centralized architecture.

### Centalized architecture
(has in background some kind of centralized related image?)

This type of architecture is based on client-server model where clients make 
requests and recieve recourses from a centralized location.

### Peer to Peer (e.g.: Bitorrent)
(has p2p related image)

Peer-to-peer technology enables peers (members) of the network to have equivalent capabilities and resposabilities when sharing resources without relying on centralized authority.

In other words, in some cases, peers donate portions of processing power, memory, or network bandwith to other participating peers.

There exist several types of P2P networks:

* Collaborative computing - combines idle or unused resource of individual workstations. AKA Distibuted computing
* Instant messaging - enables real time communication
* Affinity Communities - based around file distribution

Amazon cloud cluster is an example of a hybrid between centralized and distributed computing. Data is often stored and proccessed in various locations of the globe to improve reliability and performance.

What if we could make the next generation Web work like that across the entire Internet. AWS provides an exceptional service, there is no denying that, but when it comes to hosting resources, what if we could enable everyone resposible for providing content as much as consuming? 

Some of you may have heard of Bittorent protocol (based on P2P architecture) being used for illegal file sharing. Did you know that:

* Blizzard uses BiTorrent to distributed their games and updates
* Facebook and Twitter use BiTorrent internally
* The Internet Archive offers their content through this technology
* Government Agencies use it
* Linux ISO's are distributed using BiTorrent

Some people believe, the more organizations and inviduals that would become involved, the more redundant, safe and fast the services would become. P2P based technologies could help us achieve that.

### Blockchain technology (e.g.: Bitcoin)
(has blockchain related image)

Blockchain technology could help manage and secure the Decentralized Web data.

A blockchain (aka distributed ledger) is comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. These digitally recorded "blocks" of data are stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain contains data which is cryptographically hashed. The block of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which comes before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall "blockchain" has not been tampered with and remains unchanged.

Various kinds of data can be recorded in a blockchain and unline traditional 
data storage, which consists of centralized administration, blockchain has 
the benefit of being distributed.

It can be applied in:

* Finance - Secure and instant transactions involving currency
* Property - It can be used to track unique histories of physical and 
    non-physical property
* Contracts - Programmable, self executing and self enforcing contracts
    Applicable in various industries such as the Music and Real Estate
* Identity - Revolutionizing how we verify, authorize and manage unique 
    identities across the web


### Distributed Verison control (e.g.: git)
(has git related image)

Git is a good example of a peer-to-peer approach that has had a revolutionary effect to this whole industry. It is now being used by the majority.

As oposed to a centralized repository that everyone was working with, git enabled us all to have our own copy of the codebase and introduced some important differences from a centralized system.

* Allows private work and without needing a network connection
* Allows participation in project without permission
* Each repo effectively fuctions as a remote backup which improves redundancy
* Making most operations fast
* Communication is only necessary when sharing changes


Now let us turn back to Ozzie who will give us a glimpse at some of the emerging technologies.
