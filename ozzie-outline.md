### Intro: 

What is the decentralized_web movement?

Today, Gordon and I would like to tell you about a relatively recent development
that is known as "The Decentralized Web Movement."

We will inform you about:
    * What the movement is about and why it is important
    * Explain some of the foundational technologies
        * P2P networks
        * Blockchain technology
    * Look at a few emerging technologies that could help decentralize the web

Some people believe that the current landscape of the web is quickly shifting 
into something that looks and works differently when compared with the 
expectations of the pioneers of the web.

More recently, the web at large is becoming fragmented and those fragments (or 
"silos" as per Berners-Lee) becoming heavily centralized, succeptible to 
corportate and government control, censorship, poor privacy practices and so on.

The current state of the web suffers from a lack of permanence and in some 
cases reliability.

These are some of the concerns of advocates who urge more people to get involved in projects and technologies that could help mitigate this shift. 


The development of technologies based on decentralized architecture has been going on for some time but this year as a result of growing concerns, there was a gathering of developers in San Francisco on June 8th and 9th of 2016, to discuss how to make the web more secure, permanent, and resilient to censorship. Among the attendees were Sir Tim Berners-Lee (early web pioneer), Bewrster Khale (Internet Archive), Mitchell Baker (Mozilla Project), Vint Cerf (co-creator of TCP/IP). The hope seems to be that the prestige of some of the participants will boost peoples interest in this movement.

The essense of that meeting was centerd around the topic of how to create decentralized systems taking inspiration from already existing technologies such as: P2P, Blockchain, Distributed Networking and more.

Lets swtich over to Gordon, who will tell us a little about some of these foundational technologies that the decentralized web may be based upon.


### Quotes: 

  * Samer Hassan <sup>Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University</sup>

  > "Although originally decentralized, nowadays the Web is suffering the surveillance of U.S. centralized control monopolies. The Decentralized Web is the global effort to re-decentralize the infrastructure, protocols, applications and governance of the Web."

  * Tim Berners-Lee <sup>Inventor of World Wide Web, Director of the W3C</sup>

  > A Web that's open, works internationally, works as well as possible, and is not nation-based. Some people think need another revolution in the architecture, a little one, to make the web work again in the way it was intended. I call it â€˜re-decentralizing the web.

  * Feross Aboukhadijeh <sup>Founder of WebTorrent</sup>

  > "The Decentralized Web is a system of interconnected, independent, privately owned computers that work together to provide private, secure, censorship-resistant access to information and services."
