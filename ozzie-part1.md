## Intro

What is the decentralized_web movement?

Today, Gordon and I would like to tell you about a relatively recent development that is becoming known as "The Decentralized Web Movement."

### We will inform you about:

* What the movement is about and why it is important
* Explain some of the foundational technologies
    * P2P networks
    * Blockchain technology
    * (Distributed architecture)
* Look at a few emerging technologies that could help decentralize the web

The topic of Decentralized Web is not clearly defined and it means many things to many people, however the underlying theme revolves around the idea that we are experiencing a shift from free form to a form of consolidation and control.

### SHOW QUOTES HERE:

### What the movement is about and why its important

At its inception, the internet was being designed to be decentralized. Today, some believe the web is turning into something that looks and works differently when compared with the expectations of the pioneers of the web.

More recently, the web at large is becoming fragmented and those fragments (or silos as per Berners-Lee) becoming heavily centralized. These data silos hold all the information about us and in some cases we can not control this data, nor use it in any other way.

The web has become more succeptible to global surveilance aparatus, corportate and government control, censorship, poor privacy practices, relatively weak security, lack of permanence and in some cases reliability.

These are some of the concerns of advocates who urge more people to get involved in projects and technologies that could help mitigate this shift. 

The development of technologies based on decentralized architecture has been going on for some time but this year as a result of growing concerns, there was a gathering of developers in San Francisco on June 8th and 9th of 2016, to discuss how to make the web more secure, permanent, and resilient to censorship. 

Among the attendees were Sir Tim Berners-Lee (early web pioneer), Bewrster Khale (Internet Archive), Mitchell Baker (Mozilla Project), Vint Cerf (co-creator of TCP/IP). The hope seems to be that the reputation of some of the participants will boost peoples interest in this movement.

The essense of that meeting was centerd around the topic of how to create decentralized systems taking inspiration from already existing technologies such as: P2P, Blockchain, Distributed Networking and more.

Lets swtich over to Gordon, who will tell us a little about some of these foundational technologies that the decentralized web may be based upon.
