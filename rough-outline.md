What is Distributed web movement?

* Quotes

  * Samer Hassan <sup>Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University</sup>

  > "Although originally decentralized, nowadays the Web is suffering the surveillance of U.S. centralized control monopolies. The Decentralized Web is the global effort to re-decentralize the infrastructure, protocols, applications and governance of the Web."

  * Tim Berners-Lee <sup>Inventor of World Wide Web, Director of the W3C</sup>

  > A Web that's open, works internationally, works as well as possible, and is not nation-based. Some people think need another revolution in the architecture, a little one, to make the web work again in the way it was intended. I call it â€˜re-decentralizing the web.

  * Feross Aboukhadijeh <sup>Founder of WebTorrent</sup>

  > "The Decentralized Web is a system of interconnected, independent, privately owned computers that work together to provide private, secure, censorship-resistant access to information and services."


  A growing number of people believe that the way the internet was envisioned in the early days has been moving into a much different direction.

  The "free and open" is not so free and not so open.

  * Why its important
    * Because the current net is getting too centralized
    * Because of survailance
